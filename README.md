# Coold CSS animated Planets

Well, I do this while looking at this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M-rZIukXy0&list=WL&index=1) made by [Ania Kubow](https://www.youtube.com/c/AniaKubów), this a very simple version of the original, no shadows or fancy stuff, just the basic concept.

Why I didn't follow the whole project? For respect to my mental sanity because I was doing a different solor system and that means **having to recalculate everything in the project**

## Facts of this project

### List of stuff I (and You) could do with this Project:

- **Responsive?**: Actually yes is quite easy to do, just rotate the parent container 90° degrees and thats all, that's the easy path, making the classic media query adjustment can be a nightmare because the animaniton changes with scale.

- **Animations, 3D Effect and Scale**: You can be **REALLY** precise with all datails of the project wiith a hypotetical tool that can help you to check the porcentual position of the animation, or just slow and painful trial and error.

- **More Planets**: Sounds like a good idea but each one can exponesialy incresse the complexcity of the project.

- **Backgound datails**: easiest part probaly, just add a starfield image.

- **Hovering over Planets**: Sound like a cool idea to hover or just click on a planet to get datails about.

### Things I do different in comparasion to the Video

- Color Scheme in General

- Planets have different positions

- Keyframes are different

- I didn't use transform

- Ids and Classes have defferent names

- For some buggy reason I add a lot of box shadow properties to make it work and anyways it mostly works, but not always :/

- Has a visual bug

### What I learned from this?

- **Using the transform alternatives**: scale, rotate and translate are now CSS properties instead of arguments of the transform property, and they work as intended.

- **Keyframes**: Are cool and can help to make some crazy stuff with all that flexibility.

- **Animation propeties**: This project help to understand animations on CSS.

- **Code is fun**: I already know this, but is nice to remember it.
